ATM Interface
The ATMInterface program is a console-based ATM application. It allows users to register, log in, and perform various banking operations such as viewing balance, withdrawing, depositing, transferring, and viewing transaction history. The user data is stored in a HashMap for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, a database would be used for secure data storage. This program demonstrates basic Java concepts, including classes, methods, control structures, and data manipulation.
